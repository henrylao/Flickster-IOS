### Notes
* IOS Swift Storyboard == Android XML
	- a bit more better integrated, Android requires a bit more manual calling of scenes whereas a storyboard can contain multiple/different scenes
* swift == java
* Cocoa touch class for creating a view controller
* Add images by drag and drop into the opened Assets folder
* Launch screen is essentially a static display, can't link w/ code
* Use UITableView
* Adopt a strict approach when following and using the code when practicing/learning the basics
* IMPORTANT: configure project to use Storyboard as the main UI
* ensure DEBUG is disabled ie ensure breakpoints are turned off b/c the DEBUG mode is not the usual intelliji UI

In-class Notes:
* "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key <insert Obj>"
* 

Creating a table viewer:
1. inherit from the necessary classes: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate
2. Implement the required funcs as a result of inheritance
3. Implement client fetching of data within the controller viewDidLoad
4. Call reloading of the TableView member variable after the client completes data fetching
